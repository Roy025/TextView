    <string name="fireflies" >You would not believe your eyes
If ten million fireflies
Lit up the world as I fell asleep
Cause they fill the open air
And leave teardrops everywhere
Youd think me rude but I would just stand and stare\n\n
Id like to make myself believe that planet earth turns slowly
Its hard to say that Id rather stay awake when Im asleep
Cause everything is never as it seems
Cause Id get a thousand hugs
From ten thousand lightning bugs
As they tried to teach me how to dance
A foxtrot above my head
A sock hop beneath my bed
A disco ball is just hanging by a thread (thread, thread)
Id like to make myself believe that planet earth turns slowly
Its hard to say that Id rather stay awake when Im asleep
Cause everything is never as it seems (when I fall asleep)
Leave my door open just a crack
Please take me away from here
Cause I feel like such an insomniac
Please take me away from here
Why do I tire of counting sheep
Please take me away from here
When I far too tired to fall asleep
To ten million fireflies
Im weird cause I hate goodbyes
I got misty eyes as they said farewell (said farewell)
But ll know where several are
If my dreams get real bizarre
Cause Isaved a few and I keep them in a jar (jar, jar)
Id like to make myself believe that planet earth turns slowly
Its hard to say that Id rather stay awake when Im asleep
Cause everything is never as it seems (when I fall asleep)
Id like to make myself believe that planet earth turns slowly
Its hard to say that Id rather stay awake when Im asleep
ause everything is never as it seems (when I fall asleep)
